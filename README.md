âš¡ Charging-Scheduling

An advanced optimization framework for efficient scheduling and resource allocation in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations. This project integrates Hybrid Algorithms â€” Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) â€” along with Real-Time Tariffs (RTT) to minimize energy costs, improve station utilization, and enhance overall grid stability.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features

ðŸš— Dynamic EV Scheduling
Intelligently assigns EVs to charging stations by considering uncertain factors such as state of charge (SOC), arrival times, and departure times.

ðŸ§© Hybrid Optimization
Combines the exploration power of HGSO with the precision of ILP to achieve near-optimal EV-to-station assignments, reducing energy consumption and operational costs.

âš¡ Real-Time Energy Management
Continuously adapts to real-time fluctuations in electricity prices, charging rates, and grid conditions for maximum efficiency.

ðŸ”„ V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) Integration
Supports bidirectional energy flow, enabling EVs to supply energy back to the grid during peak demand and contribute to grid balancing.

ðŸ“Š Smart Grid Ready
Designed for integration into urban smart infrastructures and next-generation energy systems.
