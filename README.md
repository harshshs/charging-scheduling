# charging-scheduling

An advanced optimization framework designed for efficient scheduling and resource allocation in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This project integrates Hybrid Algorithms (Henry Gas Solubility Optimization - HGSO and Integer Linear Programming - ILP) and the real time tariffs(RTT) to minimize energy costs, improve charging station utilization, and enhance grid stability.

Key features:

Dynamic EV Scheduling: Assigns EVs to charging stations considering uncertain parameters like state of charge (SOC), arrival, and departure times.
Hybrid Optimization: Combines ILP and HGSO to achieve optimal EV-to-charging station assignments, reducing energy consumption and operational costs.
Real-Time Energy Management: Adapts to real-time fluctuations in energy prices, charging rates, and grid conditions.
V2G Integration: Includes Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) support for flexible energy distribution, aiding in grid balancing during peak demand.
This project can serve as a reference for implementing smart EV charging systems in urban infrastructures and smart grids.
